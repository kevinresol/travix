Note: Since v0.11.0, Travix only supports Haxe 3.3+. If you need older Haxe, please use v0.10.5.


## Quickstart

To use Travix within one of your libs, `cd` into your project root and execute:

```bash
haxelib install travix    # if it's not installed already
haxelib run travix init   # this will ask you to input the necessary information and create a .travis.yml or GitHub Actions workflow YAML file
```

From there, the setup should be straight forward.


## Building

Travix has individual commands for building:

- `interp` - run tests on interpreter
- `neko` - run tests on neko
- `node` - run tests on nodejs (with hxnodejs)
- `php` - run tests on php
- `java` - run tests on java
- `js` - run tests on [puppeteer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/puppeteer) (headless browser). Customize via [`.travix/js/hooks.js`](#browser-js-hooks); `bin/js/run.js` / `bin/js/run.html` overrides still work but are deprecated and warn.
- `flash` - run tests on flash (see instructions below)
- `python` - run tests on python
- `cs` - run tests on cs
- `cpp` - run tests on cpp
- `lua` - run tests on lua
- `hl` - run tests on hashlink

So instead of having to have to define all kinds of builds and figuring out the right way to run them, this will do.

By default Travix reads `tests.hxml`. Set `TRAVIX_HXML` to use a different hxml file instead.

### Browser JS hooks

For the `js` target, Travix always writes `bin/js/run.travix.js` and `bin/js/run.travix.html`, then runs the Travix runner unless a project-owned `bin/js/run.js` is present (deprecated override).

Prefer customizing the runner with a project-root hooks file:

```js
// .travix/js/hooks.js
module.exports = {
  // port: 9000,
  // htmlFile: 'custom.html', // served from bin/js
  serveOptions(defaults) {
    return { ...defaults /*, rewrites: [...] */ };
  },
  launchOptions(defaults) {
    return { ...defaults, headless: false };
  },
  // async beforeGoto(page) {
  //   // page APIs compose with Travix defaults (e.g. extra console listeners,
  //   // exposeFunction, evaluateOnNewDocument). Use page.browser() if needed.
  // },
  // async afterGoto(page) {},
};
```

By default hooks are loaded from `.travix/js/hooks.js` under the current working directory. Set `TRAVIX_CONFIG_DIR` to use a different config root instead (hooks at `$TRAVIX_CONFIG_DIR/js/hooks.js`).

Use `beforeGoto` for page setup before navigation; `afterGoto` for post-load steps. Console output still mirrors to stdout by default — additional `page.on('console', …)` handlers in `beforeGoto` run alongside it.

If `bin/js/run.js` or `bin/js/run.html` exists, Travix still uses them for backward compatibility and prints a migration warning.


### Using Travix in your code

There are differences among platforms about logging and exiting the process.
For example, we run JS tests on PhantomJS where your test code needs to communicate
with the Phantom host in some special ways in order to log or exit the process.
And on Flash you need to use `flash.Lib.trace` and `flash.system.System.exit(status)`.

In order to ease the pain, Travix provides a unified interface for these functionalities.
Use them to instead of `trace()`, `Sys.exit()`, etc, for maximum compatibility across platforms

- `travix.Logger.print(string)`: Print a string without newline
- `travix.Logger.println(string)`: Print a string with newline
- `travix.Logger.exit(exitCode)`: Exit the process

If you don't want to introduce a hard compile dependency to Travix in your code for some reason, you can also use the `travix.Logger`
in combination with the compile condition `#if travix` that will result in the `travix.Logger` being used when executing builds via
travix but bypass it when executed without.

For example:

```haxe
inline function println(v:String)
  #if travix
    travix.Logger.println(v);
  #elseif (flash || air || air3)
    flash.Lib.trace(v);
  #elseif (sys || nodejs)
    Sys.println(v);
  #else
    trace(v);
  #end
```

The BDD library [Buddy](https://github.com/ciscoheat/buddy) has built-in support for flash and JS testing, so if you're using Buddy you don't even have to worry about the above.


## Reasons to use Travix

Apart from helping the pathologically lazy to set up a CI, the strength of Travix lies in that it deals with dependencies rather gracefully:

1. it relies on the [`haxelib.json`](http://lib.haxe.org/documentation/creating-a-haxelib-package/) to install haxelib dependencies. It also uses the `haxelib dev` command to "mount" your library as a haxelib, giving you all the extra features, e.g. the presense of your `-D libname` flag and the inclusion of `extraParams.hxml` in the build. This happens with the `install` command.
2. it follows a fail-fast philosophy. What's that supposed to mean? Normally, in your CI, you will install all dependencies before running any of the tests. If you wait for the installation of hxjava, hxcpp, hxcs, mono and php, only to make your first test abort because of a missing semi-colon or a similarly silly mistake, it can be rather frustrating. To avoid that problem, Travix diverges from the usual modus operandi of having distinct installation and execution phases, and instead installs such dependencies right before execution, e.g. in the `cs` command.


## Reasons not to use Travix

The motivation behind Travix is to be able to spin up CI setups quickly, for many small libraries (in my case the `tink` libs). It is very likely, that it will not scale up to bigger projects, particularly when multiple builds need to be run in unison to have a test. If you have suggestions - or better yet: pull requests - to make Travix more useful for such cases, you are highly welcome.


## How to use git version

In your `.travis.yml` simply replace `haxelib install travix` with the following:

```
haxelib git travix https://github.com/back2dos/travix
```
